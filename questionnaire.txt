    It took me about 10-12 hours broken up into multiple days.

2. 
    I rewatched some lectures, and used Google for some things I couldn't get

3. 
    I asked Amanda Halley and Ryan Tibbo for some help on some things

4. 
    I never messaged my instructors

5. 
    I did find this a little difficult, but I've been struggling a little with Java from the beginning. 
    It is a lot of information to know, but with more practice, it should grow on me.
    Im gonna continue to rewatch lectures or do practices so I can better understand it.
